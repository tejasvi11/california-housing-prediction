# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning solution for predicting housing prices in California using the **California Housing Dataset**. It follows the structure and best practices recommended in the book **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📦 **Dataset**: California Housing from StatLib
- 📊 **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 🧼 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, pipelines
- 📈 **Modeling**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Cross-validation, GridSearchCV, RMSE
- 📦 **Export**: Trained model serialized with `joblib`

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Load Data** using Scikit-Learn and Pandas
2. **Visualize** and explore with Seaborn and Matplotlib
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, handle missing values
4. **Train-Test Split** and Stratified Sampling
5. **Build Pipelines**: Custom transformers, feature scaling, etc.
6. **Model Training** with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
7. **Model Evaluation** using RMSE, Grid Search, Cross-validation
8. **Save the Model** with `joblib` or `pickle`
9. **Deployment Ready**: Serialized model can be used in production
